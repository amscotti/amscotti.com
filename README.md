Introduction
-------
I made this site to give people more insight into myself. Part of a job interview is not only to grade skill level but to be able to see if the candidate is a good fit with your current team. This is important for both the interviewer and interviewee. I also feel that a lot of a details about a person is missed in an interview due to the nature of the meeting. I hope this site gives you a better idea of who I am and helps you answer some questions that may not come up in an interview. In the end, it's not just going to help myself but also help you.

Technology used
-------
This site is using technologies that I would like to use in my day to day job. This is a Ruby application using the Sinatra framework hosted on Heroku. The templates are in HAML. JQuery is primarily used for the javascript work. The site design was done by myself using 960 Grid System CSS framework (keep in mind I'm far from a designer). The contact form uses Amazon's simple notification service, which pushes a message to a list that contains my e-mail and cell number. I will get an e-mail and text message with the information. This site is a work in progress and I do plan on adding additional features over time.
